	- Made all GdkColor type properties optional, closes bug 457969.
	- Fixed add/remove parent context menu actions so that they work with parentless widget 
	  references (i.e. you can add a parent to a GtkToolItemGroup's label widget
	  or a GtkButton's image widget, or remove the parent of a child of a label-widget, etc).
	- Expose internal GtkTreeSelection child of GtkTreeView so that "changed" signal 
	  can be connected to. Fixes bug 383766.
	- Included Johannes Schmid's new signal editor work, the GladeSignals are now available
	  via a GtkTreeModel implementation, this does not effect the UI much but allows signals
	  to be Drag'n'Dropped from Glade's signal editor to Anjuta somewhere.
	- Restored GtkFixed/GtkLayout background pattern.
	- Restored old GladePlaceholder background pattern.
	- Fixed mismatching PangoAttributeType with GType, closes bug 597045.

===========
Glade 3.9.0
===========

	- General build fixes for building with GTK+ 3.0, including patches from Johannes Schmid,
	  Matthias Clasen, Javier Jardón and Juan Pablo Ugarte.
	- Included the new Preview feature by Marco Diego Aurélio Mesquita.
	- Various leaks and crashes fixed.
	- GladeWidget becomes GInitiallyUnowned, refcounting improved for project dispose cycles.
	- Handle combo-box entry child properly (bug 581580).
	- Fixed crashes when textview's buffer is deleted, fix by Martin Schlemmer, bug 609748.
	- Restored property order of project objects at save time (glade files no longer container
	  irrelevant diffs).
	- Hide editor properties when the property is not available on the widget, bug 585299, 
	  fix by Marco Diego Aurélio Mesquita.
	- Fixed makefiles as per bug 521713 (patch initially by Daniel Macks).
	- Fixed mixups of properties vs packing properties (bug 637475).
	- Fixed class header of GladeEditor to update when widgets unload (patch by 
	  Marco Diego Aurélio Mesquita, bug 637541).
	- Fixed particalarly nasty crasher bug when loading/saving treestore column definitions,
	  special thanks goes to Benjamin Otte, bug 637563.
	- Add progress bar to notebook tab of currently loading project (now the whole UI doesnt
	  jam up while loading a big project).
	- Fixed notebook tab style to use the new CSS stuff.
	- Removed widgets that are not available in 3.0
	- Completely removed Libglade support
	- Removed GladeClipBoardView completely
	- Removed GladeParameter obsolete code
	- Fixed editor labels to use natural word wrapping
	- Drop GtkTables in editors in favor of GtkGrid
	- Added custom editor for editing GtkActionGroup and managing child actions
	- Ran 'indent' on source base, new Glade coding style more similar to GTK+ style
	- Removed boolean "fixed" catalog attribute, instead <create-widget-function> can
	  be used to specify a derived GladeWidget to be used in the runtime.
	- Use locale-independent strtod & dtostr. Fixes bug 616787, fix by Christian Persch.
	- Applying patch to allow better builds on win32, patch by Dieter Verfaillie, bug 634978.
	- Fixed loaded state of use-action-appearance so that it always
	  loads as FALSE if there is no "related-action" at load time (closes bug 582882).
	- Sealed entire core API, libgladeui-2 will be ABI stable after 3.10 release.
	- Removed GladeApp::update-ui signal, active-project, selection handling and implied
	  commands, everything now must be done in context of a GladeProject.
	- Optimized GladeEditor to load a widget faster by keeping all the cached pages in internal
	  vboxes and not remove/adding them but just hide/showing them (improves object selection
	  time).
	- Optimized frontend to load one palette per project, verifying the palette for version
	  information when the related project is set costs around 1 second, this is now only
	  experienced when the target version is changed in the project prefs dialog.


===========
Glade 3.7.1
===========
	- Changed "Close without saving" acelerator key from 'c' to 'w', (Aaron Brown, bug 612538)

	- Save maximized window state of all windows in session data (Marco Diego Aurélio Mesquita, bug 607670)
	- use g_timeout_add_seconds() (Javier Jardón, bug 581255)
	- Fixed signal name serialization in GtkBuilder format to use '-' instead of '_' (bug 600031)
	- Disable orientation properties completely and disregard them wherever they cause breakage
	  (Federico Mena Quintero, bug 594231)
	- Now print a summery of all missing icons at startup instead of a warning for each missing icon
	- Fixed some remaining crashers introduced by recent GSEAL patches
	- Integrated GtkToolPalette as the internal implementation of Glade's palette (bug 613956).
	- Added tooltip to palette (bug 558983)
	- Revamped internal treeview support, less warnings and better refresh of workspace when
	  editing cell renderer attributes and liststores.
	- Glade now loads/saves the "swapped" <signal> attribute.
	- Signal editor revamped to now:
	   o show documentation links
	   o show warning icons for version mismatches
	   o edit "swapped" attribute
	   o edit the user-data object using an object selection dialog.
	   o now the signal editor is a proper widget-class (Johannes Schmid, bug 618020)
	- Disallow adding of non-scrollable widgets to scrolled windows (now an informative
	  popup comes up instead).
	- Fixed hangs in menu/treeview editors (Marco Diego Aurélio Mesquita, bug 609612)

	- Added notebook tabs to the Glade frontend with informative labels (per open project).

	- Proper ordering of GtkAdjustment properties in glade files (bug 578484).
	- Refactoring work for GSEAL (Javier Jardón)
	- Avoid collapsing commands when a project is freshly saved (this fixes a false "unmodified" 
	  state after changing the same property before and after project save) (Marco Diego Aurélio Mesquita)
	- Allow litteral strings as column type definitions in GtkTreeStores (closes bug 597059).
	- Updated Glade GTK+ catalog info to include deprecations, new properties and signals since 2.18 and 2.20 
	  and some translatable strings (brought to you also in part by Johannes H. Jensen for some translatable
	  strings and Javier Jardón for some deprecations), some new objects this consequently adds:
	  o GtkEntryBuffer
	  o GtkSpinner
	  o GtkCellRendererSpinner
	- Fixed crasher editing some data types in the liststore data editor (bug 608011).
	- Enhanced the GtkEntry editor to allow the user to chose between the "text" and the "buffer" exclusively.

	- Enabled popup menus via Apple key for osx (lame but functional).

===========
	- Maintain current widget selection during commits of related-action
	  (was causing crashes when the selection changed as a result of a commit, bug 578869)

	  been added where you can switch your format, switch your target version
	  and test for incompatabilities. incompatability error dialogs are also
	  launched on save as. Target versions are saved to the glade file; 
	  TODO: patch GtkBuilder to test the required gtk+ version from
	  <requires lib="gtk+" version="2.8"> and at least warn, also let
	  third party widget developers test thier own versions using builder
	  (all new catalog tags and properties are also documented).

	  when opening the project.
	- Old parser was trashed and rewritten from the ground up.
	- New plugin support for read_widget() and write_widget(), also
	  create_eprop() which allows the plugin to create widgets to
	  edit properties in the editor (accelerators are edited from
	  the plugin now for instance).
	- Dual file format support available, its a beginning, you dont
	  get any of the GObjects that GtkBuilder supports but all widgets
	  you were formerly using with glade can now be loaded/saved in 
	  builder format.

	  after 2 years, concerning integrating widgets, the docs are
