Glade official git repository is hosted by the GNOME foundation at
gitlab.gnome.org

Maintainer
============
Glade is looking for a new maintainer, if you are interested please contact us
on gitlab.

GitLab
========
Glade bugs are tracked at

	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glade


GIT
===
You can browse the source code at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glade
To check out a copy of Glade you can use the following command:

	git clone https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glade.git

Patches
=======
Patches must be in the unified format (diff -u) and must include a
ChangeLog entry. Please send all patches to bugzilla.

It is better to use git format-patch command

```
git format-patch HEAD^
```

Coding Style
============
Code in Glade should follow the GNU style of GNOME Programming Guidelines
(https://developer.gnome.org/programming-guidelines/stable/c-coding-style.html.en),
basically this means being consistent with the surrounding code.
The only exception is that we prefer having braces always on a new line
e.g.:

```
if (...)
  {
    ...
  }
```


Note however that a lot of the current codebase still uses the following
style:

```
if (...) {
  ...
}
```


Over time we'll migrate to the preferred form.

Naming conventions:
- function names should be lowercase and prefixed with the
  file name (or, if the function is static and the name too long,
  with an abbreviation), e.g:
  `glade_project_window_my_function ()`
  `gpw_my_loooooooooong_named_fuction ()`
- variable names should be lowercase and be short but self explanatory;
  if you need more than one word use an underscore, e.g:
  `my_variable`

Also try to order your functions so that prototypes are not needed.
